## Setting up Virtual Machine for Apple Silicon Macs

COS 461 has been using VirtualBox+Vagrant to provide VM environment for the 
assignments. Unfortunately, VirtualBox does not support the newly released 
ARM-based Apple Silicon products (i.e., MacBook Pro with M1 chip). If you 
are using one of these products, please follow the instructions below for an 
alternative way of setting up the VM environment necessary for the assignments.

### Step 1: Download UTM

UTM is a virtualization software dedicated for macOS. UTM is backed by the 
QEMU emulator to provide VM support for both x86 Macs and ARM Macs. In 
addition, QEMU can emulate x86 VMs on ARM host machines and vice versa, 
though at reduced speed.

To download UTM, go to: https://mac.getutm.app to get the dmg disk image 
file, and then extract it to install the UTM application.

### Step 2: Import the VM image

We have prepared a [VM image for UTM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17t-du78P7SNDzF3Br3Y9tquHhGptZSUG/view?usp=sharing) 
(You will need your Princeton credential to access the file).

After downloading the archive file to your Mac, double-click on it to extract 
the VM image file named `cos461.utm`. Then, open the UTM application, go to 
`File > Import Virtual Machine`, and select the utm image file to import the 
VM. Now in the UTM application, you should be able to see an entry for the 
imported VM in the left column. 

Now, you can click on the start button to boot up the VM. This will open up a 
window displaying VM startup information, and the startup is complete when it 
prompts for login. While you can log into the VM using the UTM window, it is 
highly recommended to use a separate terminal window and ssh into the VM. To 
do so, open up a terminal on your Mac and type the command 
`ssh -p2222 ubuntu@localhost` and then enter the password `ubuntu` to login. 
In the meantime, leave the UTM window in the background, closing it will shut 
down your VM. Note: the port is 2222 because we assume a port mapping from 2222 to 22. 
If you are unable to ssh into the vm, check the port mapping in UTM settings and use 
whatever port is set up to be mapped to 22. 

To power off your VM, you can either run `sudo shutdown -h now` inside the VM 
or click on the poweroff button located at the top of the UTM window. To power 
cycle your VM, please shut it down first and then start it up again. The 
current version of UTM would crash if your run `sudo reboot` inside the VM.

(tip#1: By default, the VM is configured with 1 CPU core and 2GB RAM. Your VM 
could be slow since we are emulating an x86 machine on an ARM host. If your 
Mac has more than 2 cores and 4GB RAM, you can go to 
`Edit VM (top-right corner) > System` to increase RAM and the number of cores 
under Advanced Settings. You can do so only when your VM is powered off. 
Consuming half of your Mac's cores and RAM is recommended)

(tip#2: Sometimes your mouse might be trapped into the UTM window (i.e., cannot 
find the mouse on the screen), press `control+option` to release it)

### Step 3: Clone course Git repository

ssh into the VM and run `git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/COS461-Public` 
to download the course files from GitHub.

Then `cd COS461-Public/assignments` to enter the course assignment directory.

### Step 4: Setup programming environment

(Also in the VM) Now run `./setup.sh` to setup the programming environment 
necessary for the assignments. This process could take up to 30 minutes to 
complete, depending on your VM hardware configuration. 

### Step 5: Go back to the main README and follow Part B

### Notes:

You can write the code either on your Mac or inside the VM, whichever way you 
feel most comfortable with, but the testing of the code must happen inside 
the VM. However, we are unable to find a seamless directory 
sharing solution for UTM. Unlike VirutalBox+Vagrant where the assignment 
directory is shared between the VM and the host, in UTM, you will need to 
manually sync up your assignment files. 

You can use `scp` to transmit files between your VM and Mac. For example, you 
edited the `server-c.c` file on your Mac and you want to test it inside the VM, 
run `scp -P2222 <path to server-c.c on your Mac> ubuntu@localhost:<path to server-c.c on your VM>` 
to transmit the file, then run the test script inside the VM.
